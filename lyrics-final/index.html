		<p id="lyrics">Let me take you down, 
			<br />
			'cause I'm going to <em>Strawberry Fields</em>
		<br />
		Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
		<br />
		<em>Strawberry Fields forever</em>
		<br />
		<br />
		Living is easy with eyes closed
		<br />
		Misunderstanding all you see
		<br />
		It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
		<br />
		It doesn't matter much to me
		<br />
		Let me take you down, 
		<br />
		cause I'm going to <em>Strawberry Fields</em>
		<br />
		Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
		<br />
		<em>Strawberry Fields forever</em>
		<br />
		<br />
		No one I think is in my tree
		<br />
		I mean it must be high or low
		<br />
		That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right
		<br />
		That is I think it's not too bad
		<br />
		Let me take you down, 
		<br />
		cause I'm going to <em>Strawberry Fields</em>
		<br />
		Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
		<br />
		<em>Strawberry Fields forever</em>
		<br />
		<br />
		Always, no sometimes, think it's me
		<br />
		But you know I know when it's a dream
		<br />
		I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong
		<br />
		That is I think I disagree
		<br />
		<br />
		Let me take you down, 
		<br />
		cause I'm going to <em>Strawberry Fields</em>
		<br />
		Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
		<br />
		<em>Strawberry Fields forever
		<br />
		Strawberry Fields forever
		<br />
		Strawberry Fields forever</em>
		<br />
